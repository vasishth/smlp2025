     <h3>Brief history of the summer school, and motivation</h3>

The summer school was started by Shravan Vasishth in 2017, and was funded until
2024 as part of a <a
href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/sfb1287/projects/infrastructure-service-training-and-central-projects/project-q.html">methods
project</a> within the <a
href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/sfb1287/index.html">SFB 1287</a>. The summer
school aims to fill a gap in statistics education, specifically within the
fields of linguistics and psychology. One goal of the summer school is to
provide comprehensive training in the theory and application of statistics, with
a special focus on the linear mixed model.  Another major goal is to make
Bayesian data analysis a standard part of the toolkit for the linguistics and
psychology researcher. Over time, the summer school has evolved to have at least
four parallel streams: foundational and advanced courses in frequentist and
Bayesian statistics. These may be expanded to more parallel sessions in future
editions. We typically admit a total of 120 participants (in 2019, we had some
450 applications). In addition to the all-day courses, we regularly invite
speakers to give lectures on important current issues relating to statistics.

    <strong>Title</strong>: Progress and challenges in open-source
    multilevel modeling: opinions of an alien<br>

    <strong>Abstract</strong>:
In parallel with the revolution in machine learning and AI, more
traditional multilevel models are rapidly becoming more flexible,
powerful, and readily available in open-source software. I will try to
present a view that is eclectic and 'alien', i.e. covering a range of
topics from a perspective that differs from that of most of the audience
or other method developers (ecology, little formal training in
statistics). I'll briefly review of the current landscape of mixed
modeling tools, exciting new directions, and open challenges. I will
focus on methods available in R but compare these tools with those
available in Julia and Python, as well as in some commercial software.
Other topics may include model selection, troubleshooting (convergence
and singular-fit problems), and the use of latent variables to fit
nonlinear patterns in data.

<strong>Title</strong>: Aligning theory and effects with non-canonical specifications of linear mixed models<br>

<strong>Abstract</strong>:

Inferential statistics in cognitive, behavioral, and social sciences
increasingly rely on (generalized) linear mixed models and Bayesian statistics.
Their canonical application often misses out on insights to be gained by
theory-guided considerations at different levels of model specification.
Theory-based non-canonical specifications relate to (1) the relevance of
transformations of measures and covariates, (2) nested vs crossed designs for
fixed effects and/or the random-effect structure, (3) regression discontinuity
designs, (4) (moderation by) quadratic, cubic, or spline covariates, (5)
selection against degenerate (G)LMMs,(7) correlation parameters for levels and
effects, (8) some caveats about their interpretation, and (9) conditional modes
for prediction of individual (or other group) differences in
(quasi-)experimental effects. Using examples from sport science (e.g., Bähr et
al., 2025; Teich et al., 2025), I illustrate for a subset of the above how sex,
age, body constitution, secular trends (incl. pandemic Covid-19 effects), school
social status, and interactions between these effects relate to the physical
fitness of primary-school children. With a few exceptions, these non-standard
specifications are relevant for a broad range statistical models (e.g.,
Bayesian, structural-equation, latent growth curve models).

     <h3>Courses</h3>

     <ul>

     <li><strong>Introduction to Bayesian data analysis</strong> (maximum 30 participants). Taught by
         <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/psych-methods/team/julia-haaf">Julia Haaf</a> and
         <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/de/psych-methods/team/nicole-cruz">Nicole Cruz</a>.</strong>
<br>
     <strong>

         You can decide whether this course is appropriate for you by looking at
         a previously taught online version of this course (videos are
         available): <a
         href="https://open.hpi.de/courses/bayesian-statistics2023">see
         here</a></strong>. <br><br> This course is an introduction to Bayesian
         modeling, oriented towards linguists and psychologists.  Topics to be
         covered: Introduction to Bayesian data analysis, Linear Modeling,
         Hierarchical Models, and Bayes factors. We will cover these topics within the context of
         an applied Bayesian workflow that includes exploratory data analysis,
         model fitting, and model checking using prior and posterior predictive checks.<br>

     <strong>Prerequisites</strong>:

     Participants are expected to be familiar with frequentist methodology (what
     is taught in the foundations course, see below, as well as this online
     textbook: <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/Freq_CogSci/">here</a>), be
     relatively fluent in R usage, and <strong>must</strong> have some
     experience in data analysis, particularly with the R library lme4. Basic
     high school (pre-calculus) arithmetic and mathematical fluency is assumed;
     for example, you should know what a log is, what an exponent is, and be
     able to solve for y in x=log(y/(1-y)). If you are unfamiliar with
     frequentist methods, we suggest taking the introductory frequentist course
     listed below. <br>


     <strong>Course Materials</strong>


     The following freely available online textbook will be used: <a href="http://bruno.nicenboim.me/bayescogsci/">see here</a>.
     A hard-copy of the book is available <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Introduction-to-Bayesian-Data-Analysis-for-Cognitive-Science/Nicenboim-Schad-Vasishth/p/book/9780367359331">here</a>.


     The course will cover chapters 1-5, and possibly also chapter 13 (Bayes factors).
    <br>


     <br><br>
     <li><strong>Advanced Bayesian data analysis</strong> (maximum 30 participants). Taught by <a href="https://bnicenboim.github.io/">Bruno Nicenboim</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/himanshuyadavjnu/">Himanshu Yadav</a></li>

<br>

     This course assumes that participants have some experience in Bayesian
     modeling already using brms and want to transition to Stan to learn more
     advanced methods and start building simple computational cognitive models.
     Participants should have worked through or be familiar with the material in
     the first five chapters of our book draft: <a
     href="http://bruno.nicenboim.me/bayescogsci/">Introduction to Bayesian
     Data Analysis for Cognitive Science</a>. In this course, we will cover
     Parts III to V of our book draft: model comparison using Bayes factors and
     k-fold cross validation, introduction and relatively advanced models with
     Stan, and simple computational cognitive models. <br>

     <strong>Course Materials</strong>

     Textbook: <a href="http://bruno.nicenboim.me/bayescogsci/">see here</a>.
     A hard-copy of the book is available <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Introduction-to-Bayesian-Data-Analysis-for-Cognitive-Science/Nicenboim-Schad-Vasishth/p/book/9780367359331">here</a>.
     We will start from Part III of the book (Advanced models with Stan). Participants are expected to be familiar with the first six chapters.<br><br>

     <li><strong>Foundational methods in frequentist statistics</strong>
     (maximum 30 participants). Taught by <a
     href="https://www.health-and-medical-university.de/universitaet/unser-team/team-fakultaet-gesundheit/professoren/prof-dr-daniel-schad-hmu-potsdam/">Daniel
     Schad</a>, and <a href="https://www.jverissimo.net/">João
     Veríssimo</a>.</li>


<br> Participants will be expected to have used linear mixed models before, and want to acquire a deeper knowledge of
frequentist foundations, and understand the linear mixed modeling framework more
deeply. Participants are also expected to have fit multiple regressions. We will
cover model selection, contrast coding, with a heavy emphasis on simulations to
compute power and to understand what the model implies. We will work on (at
least some of) the participants' own datasets. <i>This course is not appropriate
for researchers new to R or to frequentist statistics</i>.<br>

     <strong>Course Materials</strong>

     Textbook draft <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/Freq_CogSci/">here</a>.
     <br><br>

     <li><strong>Advanced methods in frequentist statistics with Julia</strong>
     (maximum 30 participants). Taught by  <a
     href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/trainingswissenschaft/staff/rkliegl.html">Reinhold
     Kliegl</a>, and <a href="https://phillipalday.com/">Phillip Alday</a>. </li>
     <br>

     Applicants must have experience with linear mixed models and be interested
     in learning how to carry out such analyses with the <a
     href="https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl">Julia-based
     MixedModels.jl package</a>) (i.e., the analogue of the R-based lme4
     package). MixedModels.jl has some significant advantages stemming from a
     faster implementation incorporating several algorithmic advances. The speed
     improvements make it easier to fit larger and more complex models as well
     as perform the repetitive model fitting necessary for power simulation and
     bootstrapping.</br>

     <br>We <strong>do not expect</strong> profound knowledge of Julia from
     participants; the necessary subset of knowledge will be taught on the first
     day of the course. We do expect a readiness to <a
     href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">install Julia</a> and the
     confidence that with some basic instruction participants will be able to
     adapt prepared Julia scripts for their own data or to adapt some of their
     own lme4-commands to the equivalent MixedModels.jl-commands.  There is good
     interoperability between R and Julia (with <a
     href="https://juliainterop.github.io/RCall.jl/stable/">RCall</a> on the
     Julia side and <a
     href="https://non-contradiction.github.io/JuliaCall/index.html">JuliaCall</a>
     on the R side) so that users can continue using R as necessary for e.g.
     data wrangling and plotting. <br><br>

<h3>Fees and accommodation</h3>

The summer school is free. Participants who are
accepted are expected to arrange their own accommodation. We strongly advise
participants to find a place to stay near Griebnitzsee campus, and not in
Berlin. The reason is that German train personnel tend to go on strike every
year around the time of the summer school. You will be better off if you can get
easily to the Griebnitzsee campus.
